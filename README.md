## Overview
### Description
contented is a content creation management application that incorporates intention-setting and other follower-boosting methods to motivate and support creators 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Productivity
- **Mobile:** Since the app is intended to be intuitive and easily accessible, mobile is the main focus for contented's MVP, though expansion to a companion web-app is possible for the future. Weekly notifications for content intention-setting also depends on mobile's readiness for users.
- **Story:** Enables users to plan content creation goals across social media platforms 
- **Market:** People interested in content creation and growing a following on the internet could utilize this app.
- **Habit:** Users set intentions at the beginning of each week and, depending on how often they want to post, check in multiple times throughout the week to ensure they stay on track.
- **Scope:** contented would start out with a focus on intention-setting and have a view of the content creator's week/month. Later versions would include tools to help boost creator's following, such as pointing out where to comment on popular YouTube videos to draw attention to user's channel. Later versions could also incorporate social aspects for multiple users to work on a certain handle and/or support each other.
